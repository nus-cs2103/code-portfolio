**My role:** This is a team project that I (with 4 other classmates) did for a Software Engineering course at [NUS, SoC](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). Unlike most school projects, this was a brownfield project -- starting with an exisiting code base, we evolved the product through three iterations.  I contributed to all parts of the product, and all aspects of the project. Some notable pull requests:

* Feature implementations: [Duplicate contacts warning](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/96) | [Clear confirmation](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/82)
* Test code: [Update tests for new features](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/46) | [Fix failing tests](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/117)
* Documentation: [Updates to Developer Guide](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/265) | [Updates to User Guide](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/155)
