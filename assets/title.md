# Jane Doe's Code Portfolio

Welcome to my code portfolio page, created to showcase some of the code I've written in various projects.

Notes:
* In _code contribution timelines_ given below, each triangle represents a commit (and the area of the triangle is proportional to the size of the commit).
* You can click on the `</>` icon (shown above the timelines) to view the cumulative code I contributed to that project.
